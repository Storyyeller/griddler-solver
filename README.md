Griddler Solver is a browser-agnostic web application designed to solve and visualize traditional black and white griddler puzzles.  It was developed as a senior design project at the request of Dr. David Smith, a professor in the College of Computing at the Georgia Institute of Technology.

Griddler Solver is intended to be a recreational puzzle solving tool.  It is not intended to be used as a tool for the development of new griddler puzzles.

Griddler Solver allows users to upload griddlers stored locally, scrape griddlers from external sites, and visualize the method used to solve these puzzles through an interactive user interface. Finally, users are able to export griddlers that have been previously scraped from an external site for use at a later time.
