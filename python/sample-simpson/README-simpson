This files in this directory are in a format designed to be used by the
following programs:

 * Steve Simpson's Nonogram Solver
   http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~ss/software/nonowimp/

 * Kuang-che Wu's Naughty
   http://kcwu.csie.org/~kcwu/nonogram/naughty/

 * Jan Wolter's pbnsolve
   http://webpbn.com/pbnsolve.html

Only two-color puzzles are supported.

This is a fairly rich and extensible file format.  It is documented at:
http://www.comp.lancs.ac.uk/~ss/nonogram/fmt2

The examples in this directory include an image of the goal solution as well
as the clues.  Simpson's program will ignore this and it is not part of
Simpson's original file definition, but it can be used by pbnsolve.
Documentation for these extensions is in the README file for the pbnsolve
program.
